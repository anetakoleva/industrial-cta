# industrial-cta

This is a repository with the supplementary material files for the paper "Beyond the Lookup: Learning to Annotate Tables Using Semantic Data Models in Industry" which is submitted to the ISWC In-Use Track. 


Here we share the equipment ontology file equipment_onto.owl and the diagram explaining it. We share the queries that we used for extracting keywords from POSC Caeser and QUDT, and the lists of keywords that we used for the labeling functions.


The upper ontology ISO 15926-14 can be accessed [here](https://rds.posccaesar.org/ontology/lis14/ont/core/).
The pretrained TURL model which is used as table-encoder in the paper is accessible on this [link](https://github.com/sunlab-osu/TURL).

Here is the diagram of the equipment ontology
